* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


To use:



In order to install, first download the files. Then you would open terminal and type ```npm install``` . This will install all the npm packages listed under the dependencies in the package.json.(MySQL, express, express-handlebars, Node) Then you will open  MySQLworkbench and copy the data in schema.sql file in a SQL file. Once you click on the execute button database table is created for you locally. Then you will open terminal again and type the command ``` node server.js```. This will connect the server. Finally you will type ```localhost:3000``` in the browserwindow and use the application. If you would like to make changes to the application code files , you will have to restart the server after each change. To avoid that, you can install nodemon and use the command ```nodemon``` in the terminal so that it will automatically restart the server for you after each change.

# Some React documentaions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
